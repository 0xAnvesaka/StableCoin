# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/IndianRupeeCoin.sol [Line: 19](src/IndianRupeeCoin.sol#L19)

	```solidity
	contract IndianRupeeCoin is ERC20Burnable, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/IndianRupeeCoin.sol [Line: 26](src/IndianRupeeCoin.sol#L26)

	```solidity
	    function burn(uint256 _amount) public override onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/IndianRupeeCoin.sol [Line: 37](src/IndianRupeeCoin.sol#L37)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operation

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 148](src/IRTEngine.sol#L148)

	```solidity
	        bool success = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).transferFrom(
	```

- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 351](src/IRTEngine.sol#L351)

	```solidity
	        bool success = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).transfer(
	```

</details>



## L-3: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 3](src/IRTEngine.sol#L3)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

- Found in src/IndianRupeeCoin.sol [Line: 3](src/IndianRupeeCoin.sol#L3)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

</details>



## L-4: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/libraries/OracleLib.sol [Line: 22](src/libraries/OracleLib.sol#L22)

	```solidity
	    function staleCheckLatestRoundData(
	```

</details>



## L-5: `nonReentrant` is Not the First Modifier

To protect against reentrancy in other modifiers, the `nonReentrant` modifier should be the first modifier in the list of modifiers.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 138](src/IRTEngine.sol#L138)

	```solidity
	        nonReentrant
	```

- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 180](src/IRTEngine.sol#L180)

	```solidity
	    ) public moreThanZero(amountCollateral) nonReentrant {
	```

- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 197](src/IRTEngine.sol#L197)

	```solidity
	    ) public moreThanZero(amountIrtToMint) nonReentrant {
	```

- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 230](src/IRTEngine.sol#L230)

	```solidity
	    ) external moreThanZero(debtToCover) nonReentrant {
	```

</details>



## L-6: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 3](src/IRTEngine.sol#L3)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

- Found in src/IndianRupeeCoin.sol [Line: 3](src/IndianRupeeCoin.sol#L3)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

- Found in src/libraries/OracleLib.sol [Line: 3](src/libraries/OracleLib.sol#L3)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
	```

</details>



## L-7: Modifier Invoked Only Once

Consider removing the modifier or inlining the logic into the calling function.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 85](src/IRTEngine.sol#L85)

	```solidity
	    modifier isAllowedToken(address token) {
	```

</details>



## L-8: Storage Array Length not Cached

Calling `.length` on a storage array in a loop condition is expensive. Consider caching the length in a local variable in memory before the loop and reusing it.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 443](src/IRTEngine.sol#L443)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < s_collateralTokens.length; i++) {
	```

</details>



## L-9: State Change Without Event

There are state variable changes in this function but no event is emitted. Consider emitting an event to enable offchain indexers to track the changes.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 195](src/IRTEngine.sol#L195)

	```solidity
	    function mintIrt(
	```

- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 207](src/IRTEngine.sol#L207)

	```solidity
	    function burnIrt(uint256 amount) public moreThanZero(amount) {
	```

</details>



## L-10: State Variable Could Be Immutable

State variables that are only changed in the constructor should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/IRTEngine.sol [Line: 57](src/IRTEngine.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	    address[] private s_collateralTokens;
	```
